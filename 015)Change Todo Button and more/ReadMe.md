About this.
=============================================================

	This is the last folder about the project we had.It is not meant to be perfect but now we include a css file too,
	that is connected to our HTML file.Feel free to tweak the styles.css and see the outcomes of your code.Also, in
	the script.js i included 2 more buttons,change and completed so we are making our input fields less and easier for the uer.
	Feel free to try more stuff and make it even more User Friendly.I hope those folders helped you to understand better
	the majesty of Javascript although the difficulty and also,i hope you now feel more familiar with the DOM, event listeners,
	functions,objects and all the rest we visited here one by one.
	Keep up the hard work!
	Cheers!
