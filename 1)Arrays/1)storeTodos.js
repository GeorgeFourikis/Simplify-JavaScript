//Lets break down the piece of Storing the Todos.
//First go to Google Chrome,right click on the main page and select 
//inspect Element,click it.There you will see the Chrome Developer Tools
//Now Select the Tab "Console".This will be your closest friend
//when writing Javascript.

//Back to the Storing Todos now.
//A simple way to store a list of items in Javascript is by
//building an array.

var arr = [1,2,3,"hello","world",true,false];
//The above code is this.We store a variable named arr as an
//array,the arrays can store all Javascript data types.As you
//can see i have stored in the arr array strings,numbers and booleans.

var todoArray = ['must do laundry', 'go swimming', 'train hard']
//Notice that when i can both use double quotes or single quotes
//to pass a String.

var name = "John Doe" //is the same as 
var name = 'John Doe'
