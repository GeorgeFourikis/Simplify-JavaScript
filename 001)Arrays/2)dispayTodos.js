//Now we will see how to display things we stored.
//Go to your Chrome Developer Tools (Console) and type that
console.log('hello world'); //hit enter

//i see that the message is printed in the console.
var todos = ['say hi', 'go walk', 'go to the store'];
console.log(todos);

//notice that i save an array to a variable and then i pass it as 
//a variable inside console.log.I do not use single or double quotes
//because if i would do that i would literally see the word todos
//displayed in the console.
//I can print multiple items using console.log

//use that:
var todos = ['say hi', 'go walk', 'go to the store'];
console.log('my todos', todos);
